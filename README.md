# Mechanic manager +

An OpenRCT2 plugin for managering the mechanics.

Brings up a new window and another way to manage mechanics which makes a faster way to edit mechanic job orders through the table/list view. 

Also this plugin gives to mechanics a new task opportunity `Fix additions` for repairing the vandalism.

Choosing the mechanic to fix addition, makes them stop on broken additions and play an random repairing animation.

This is based on [Animated vandalism repairing plugin](https://github.com/jpknen/openrct2-animated-vandalism-repairing) and shares most of its logic.

### Features:
- Mechanic manager window and custom mechanic windows
- Add/delete mechanics
- Change mechanic job task's: `Inspect rides, Fix rides, Fix additions (vandalism)`
- Option to skip vandalism fixing if mechanic is heading for the ride (currently works only for ride fixing, not inspecting)
- Possibility to give different color work clothes depending on the job

### Notes:

Plugin works with OpenRCT2 `v0.4.12` or later.

I do not recommend to use this and Animated vandalism repairing plugin same time.

### Install:

Copy the latest [release](https://github.com/jpknen/openrct2-mechanic-manager-plus/releases/) into to your OpenRCT2 plugin folder `C:/Users/[name]/Documents/OpenRCT2/plugin`
